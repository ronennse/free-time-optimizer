Project Requirements: # Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Free Time Maximizer App

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building an application that helps users make the most out of their free time by intelligently scheduling activities. The app will collect a variety of users' interests—like exercise routines, TV series, books, social activities, and more—and then use this information to suggest the most appropriate activity for any available free time slot. It seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar to fetch existing time slots, ensuring that the suggestions fit within the user’s real-world schedule.

The primary goal is to maximize personal productivity and leisure by striking a balance between various interests. By automatically adapting plans based on changes in available time and recent activity history, the app aims to reduce scheduling hassles and help users enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle. The key objectives include providing a user-friendly smart scheduling system, supporting multiple tenants with personalized profiles, and offering flexible activity planning and adaptation while following a modern and minimalistic design approach.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   User authentication including multi-tenant support and personalized profiles.
*   Input interface allowing users to add interests and activities using both preset options and custom entries.
*   Calendar integration with Google Calendar for automatic free time detection.
*   Intelligent activity suggestion engine that takes into account the length of free time available, time of day, and recent user activities.
*   Adaptive scheduling that can adjust planned activities dynamically (e.g., compressing a two-hour workout to one hour).
*   Customizable prioritization rules with a default balanced recommendation.
*   Notifications and reminders to inform users of upcoming free time slots and scheduled activities.
*   A modern, minimalistic user interface that is easy to navigate.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Advanced social or group scheduling features beyond individual user planning.
*   In-depth analytics or reporting dashboards for tracking long-term user performance.
*   Offline functionality or local calendar synchronization (only online, calendar-driven scheduling is in scope).
*   Extensive custom branding options beyond a modern, minimalistic design.

## 3. User Flow

A new user starts by visiting the modern, welcoming landing page where they can choose to register or log in. After registration, the user sets up their profile by entering personal preferences, selecting preset interests (like exercising, learning, or watching TV), and adding any custom activities. Once their profile is created, the user can either manually input available free time or connect the app to their Google Calendar to automatically discover open time slots. The interface clearly displays sections for profile setup, interest input, and scheduling options.

Once the free time is identified, the app reviews the user's list of interests along with recent activity history to suggest an optimal activity. If the situation changes (for example, a previously planned two-hour workout needs adjustment because only one hour is now available), the system intelligently adapts the plan by prioritizing key exercises. The user reviews the suggested plan, with clear options to accept, modify, or reschedule the activity. Throughout the process, notifications inform the user of upcoming scheduled activities or any last-minute changes, ensuring continuous adaptation and seamless management of free time.

App Flow: # App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user visits the application, they are greeted with a modern and minimalistic landing page that instantly provides an overview of the app’s purpose and benefits. The landing page explains that the app is designed to help users maximize their free time by digesting a wide range of interests such as exercising, meeting friends, learning, watching TV series and movies, and spending quality time with family. New users are encouraged to create an account. The registration process allows for sign-up using an email address or social login methods if available. After entering the required credentials, the user is guided to complete basic profile setup where they input their interests and set initial prioritization rules. Once registered, users can sign in with their credentials or by using a social login. There is also an option to recover lost passwords through a “Forgot Password” flow that typically involves sending a recovery link to the registered email. When signed in, users have the option to sign out gracefully via a clearly marked sign-out button that is accessible from every page, ensuring that their session can be ended safely and securely.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After completing the onboarding process, users are directed to the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all activities. The dashboard is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, showcasing a header at the top, a sidebar for navigation, and a central area that displays upcoming free time suggestions and recently used features. Users see sections for activity inputs, calendar integration status, and notifications for upcoming free time opportunities or adjustments to scheduled plans. This page also features quick access to profile settings, activity logs, and customization options. Navigation between these major sections is seamless, with a menu that clearly shows how to move between scheduling, reviewing activity suggestions, and managing personal preferences.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The application fully integrates the core features that help users plan and optimize their free time. Once the user is on the dashboard, they have the option to navigate to the interest input and activity detail section. Here, the user can choose from a library of preset activities like exercise, learning sessions, social meets, and media consumption, or add custom activities that reflect their unique interests. Each activity input includes details like preferred duration, time windows, and customization for priority. Once input is complete, users move to the scheduling interface where they can enter available free time manually or allow the app to connect to Google Calendar to automatically detect free slots. When a free time block is identified, for example, one hour available at 17:00, the app shows a dynamic overview of scheduled activities and any free time available. The most notable feature here is the adaptive planning feature. If a user’s schedule unexpectedly changes, such as a planned two-hour workout becoming a one-hour session, the application intelligently recalibrates by suggesting the most important elements of the activity and re-prioritizing activities like meeting friends or catching up on a TV series. In addition to the core flow, an advanced workflow may allow seasoned users to dive deeper into fine-tuning various activity parameters, custom priority rules, or even access a temporary administration panel to review activity logs and adjust recommendations. Transitioning between pages is smooth, with each action (whether adding an activity, scheduling free time, or reviewing a suggestion) ensuring that changes are immediately reflected in the user’s profile and dashboard without any disruption.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can manage their personal information and preferences through an easily accessible account management section that can be reached from the main dashboard. In this section, users update their profile details, define customization rules for activity prioritization, and adjust notification settings to ensure they receive timely reminders about upcoming schedules and free time opportunities. The settings page also facilitates calendar integration with Google Calendar; users can reconnect or adjust sync settings, ensuring the seamless integration of their real-world calendar events with the app’s planning engine. Additionally, users find subscription or billing details here if the app includes premium features or multi-tenant configurations meant for a broader audience. After adjusting settings, users can return to the main dashboard via clearly marked navigation options that ensure continuity of the overall app flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is designed to handle errors gracefully. Should a user enter invalid data during registration or activity input, the app immediately displays clear error messages in plain language and highlights the problematic fields, ensuring the user can quickly correct any mistakes. In the case of connectivity issues or disruptions in calendar synchronization, fallback pages explain the situation and provide options to retry the connection or manually input data. When restricted actions are attempted, such as accessing certain features without the necessary permissions, the application informs the user with a polite message and offers alternative paths, such as guidance on upgrading their account or checking settings. Each error state is presented within the consistent visual design of the app, ensuring the user experience remains unified even in unexpected situations. The app further allows users to recover from errors without losing any progress, thereby maintaining a smooth flow from one task to the next.
